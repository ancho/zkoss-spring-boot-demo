= Small Selenium Demo using Zkoss / Springboot

This is just a sample Project to demonstrate a potential Bug in selenium
using ChromeDriver for file uploads against basic auth protected pages.

To reproduce the issue run `mvn test`

The test executes two tests that upload a *.xlsx and *.txt file.
The expectation is that the upload request contains the data payload of those files
to further process it in the application.

Instead, the transferred bytes are in both cases 0.

The upload works in general when running the application with `mvn spring-boot:run`.
Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` and try uploading a File.

The username is `user` the password is `password`.

You should see a log message in the terminal console like this:

`File uploaded with name: 'test-upload-file.txt' and size: 38`
